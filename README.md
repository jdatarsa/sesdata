## Introduction
This repository contains datasets and code used for the manuscript as titled above. All details regarding the data source and considerations that should be noted are discussed in the manuscript; these are important to understand before embarking on any analysis of these data - in particular the differentiation between a strangles diagnosis and a positive sampling event - a single diagnosis can be made up of multiple sample events. 

## R Code  
The descriptive analysis for the manuscript was performed using R. The full code is available in the *manuscriptcode.R* file. Links to the csv datasest used are included in the code as well as the required libraries. The code published here is in a format that may assist entry-level R users in navigating through the outcomes. Piping using _dplyr_ was used throughout to create a step-for-step code base.
